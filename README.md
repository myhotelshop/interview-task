Goal is to implement a conversion tracking model for advertisers that weights various points of contacts with their customers.

### The project

The project has been developed using:

- PHP7.2 
- MySQL 8
- Symfony Framework

To be able to run the application please make sure you have the following software/s on your machine:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Composer package manager

The **Makefile** will make it easy for you to go through the whole scenarios. 
	  
### How to run the application

- Clone the project to your machine ```git clone git@github.com:engmohammedyehia/interview-task.git myhotelshop```
- Browser to the **myhotelshop** folder ```cd myhotelshop```
- Install project dependencies and run the applications by typing the following command ```make install run```
- When The installation completes you can run the unit tests using the command ```make unit-test```
- To be able to run the API testing run the command ```make api-test```
- You can also use Postman by importing the collection included with this folder but make sure to add a cookie to be able to call the /track endpoint with a value like so ```tracking={"placements": [{"platform": 1, "customer_id": 2, "date_of_contact": "2018-01-01 14:00:00"}, {"platform": 2, "customer_id": 2, "date_of_contact": "2018-01-03 14:00:00"}, {"platform": 3, "customer_id": 2, "date_of_contact": "2018-01-05 14:00:00"}]}```
- If you want to clean the project and start over you just have to run ```make clean install run```
- To view the API documentation please run the command ```make api-docs``` or browser to http://localhost:8088/docs/
- For more command please type ```make``` or ```make help```

To execute requests on Swagger documentation you need first to authorize yourself by acquiring a JWT token using the /auth endpoint 
in the Swagger docs and copy the value of the token then press on Authorize and place the value and authorize. You can now execute requests 
to different endpoints.
